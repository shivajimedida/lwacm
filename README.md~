Link-wise Artificial Compressibility Method


questioins:

1, equatioin 11, what is f(a,e,o)(x,t) and how to calculate it

2, why do we separate the loop for mesh point x into two different loops?

3, do we store all the intermediata data into the stime step t ?
   e.g. double p_store[t][N_X][N_Y][N_Z]  double u[t][N_X][N_Y][N_Z][3];
   
4, it is a good idea to declare variables as globle?
